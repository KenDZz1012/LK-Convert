UPm a healthy girl, because i have good and rich dinner. When ¡ get
up at about 6:30, my mother already cooks breakfast for me.

There are egøs, milk , bread , sausage for breakfast. i Hke milk and
bread best. so i am tall and strong.

At school, i have my lunch at 12:00. Miany students like eating lunch
in our school, because there are many delicious foods, such as fish,
chicken, hot dog , jiaozi, hamburgers and so on.

I Hke them very much, so i eat very well. For supper, i eat less than
breakfast and lunch. My mother often tells me that i should eat lessin
the eveninø, ifs good for my body.
